This is the protocol used to collect points using satellite imagery through GEE.

1. select a lat, lon point
2. view the band values in time series
3. select time-range where bands have no large changes
4. identify a classification to describe the point throughout the time-range
    * look at the images & guess
    * view how band values for this point-time-range fit in statistically vs other points in the classification
5. save the point+time-range, classification, notes, & other metadata
